# CHAPTER 1 :  Use the Five Whys for Root Cause Analysis

When solving business problems, it's important to find the real reason behind the issue — this is called the **root cause**. The **Five Whys** is a simple technique where you ask "Why?" repeatedly (usually 5 times) to uncover the root cause and fix the problem properly.

##  Example: Improving Customer Service

An online grocery store was getting complaints from customers. A data analyst used the Five Whys to investigate:

1. **Why** are customers complaining?  
   → Their groceries arrived damaged.

2. **Why** are groceries damaged?  
   → They weren’t packaged properly.

3. **Why** were they not packaged properly?  
   → Packers weren’t trained properly.

4. **Why** weren’t they trained?  
   → Many packers were new and hadn’t completed training.

5. **Why** hadn’t they completed training?  
   → HR was updating the training and used a shortcut guide.

** Root Cause:** HR had not provided proper training to new packers.  
**🛠️ Solution:** Complete the training program and retrain the new hires.

## ⚙️ Example: Fixing Product Defects

An irrigation company had more defective water pumps. The Five Whys helped:

1. **Why** are there defects?  
   → Machines weren’t calibrated correctly.

2. **Why** weren’t they calibrated?  
   → Wrong calibration during last maintenance.

3. **Why** was the calibration wrong?  
   → They used an outdated method.

4. **Why** was the method outdated?  
   → A software update changed machine behavior.

5. **Why** didn’t engineers know?  
   → Installation team didn’t share the new calibration info.

** Root Cause:** Engineers didn’t receive updated calibration instructions.  
**🛠️ Solution:** Share correct instructions. Defects stopped.
